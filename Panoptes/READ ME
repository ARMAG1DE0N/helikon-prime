  4. UI 
  5. Database - SQLite/Postgresql also looking into MySQL or SQLExpress
  6. API  - Need to get a base program together to qualify for a Bungie API key to access the game(I have been told this is incorrect, I need to research this more)
  7. Authorizations for users to have personal data
  8. hosting - AWS/GitHub hosting/ or Arm's Server computer build that just needs like 12 things to be done
